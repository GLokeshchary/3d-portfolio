        Hi! Iâ€™m Lokesh Chary Gattoji, a full-stack web developer and software
        engineer with 2.3 years of experience in the software industry, based in
        Hyderabad, India. My journey in software engineering has been both
        exciting and transformative, and I've had the privilege of working with
        a variety of technologies. I specialize in building robust applications
        using Spring Boot, Java, and Microservices on the backend, while
        leveraging React for dynamic and responsive front-end development. I am
        also skilled in functional programming principles, which I apply to
        write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. My passion for technology
        and continuous learning drives me to explore new tools and methodologies
        to create innovative solutions. I am always eager to tackle new
        challenges and contribute to projects that make a difference.
